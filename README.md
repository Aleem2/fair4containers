# FAIR for Containers
This repository services as an example in creating a FAIR Container. A Dockerfile is used to create a container. The purpose of this example container is to create an working web scraping environment based on scrapy python package.
The translation of FAIR principals to this practical guide is based on FAIR for research software article (link/cite).
1. This guide illustrates how a researcher can get their work cited by using a Citation.cff file.
2. It shows how license can be assigned and some suggestions are provided.
3. Furthermore, all this information can be packaged into the container and pushed to container registery of your choice.
4. Finally, a DOI can be assigned to finalised software and shared to wider audience or publication.
5. For further information and communication please contact aleem.uddin@ardc.edu.au
