# FAIR for Containers: A Practical Guide
This repository serves as an example for creating a FAIR Container. The Dockerfile captures the build script of a container including the dependencies. This characteristic of a container makes it possible to reproduce the exact environment. Hence covering the R component of FAIR principals. While the rest of the FAIR principals are aligned with FAIR for Research Software. 


The key things this guide addresses in making containers FAIR is as follows:
1. This guide illustrates how a researcher can get their work cited by using a Citation.cff file.
2. It shows how a license can be assigned and some suggestions are provided.
3. Furthermore, all this information can be packaged into the container and pushed to the container registry of your choice.
4. Finally, a DOI can be assigned to finalised software and shared to a wider audience or publication.
5. For further information, please contact aleem.uddin@ardc.edu.au

Note: This example container packages webscraping tool called Scrapy.
